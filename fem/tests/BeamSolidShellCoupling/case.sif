!---------------------------------------------------------
! A verification case for assembling solid and shell equations
! into a single linear system so that the coupled equations can 
! be solved simultaneously.
!
! As a reference, the case can be simplified to a beam model where the beam
! is clamped at both ends. The Euler-Bernoulli beam theory predicts
! the maximum deflection to be p b L^4/(384 EI) = 0.2025, with
! p, b and L being the surface traction, the beam width and
! the beam length. The solution of the simple beam theory is seen to be
! fairly closed to that of the more complicated coupled model.
!
! The original version P.R. 3.9.2019, 
! modified to allow a comparison with the simple beam theory 
! by M.M. June, 2020.
