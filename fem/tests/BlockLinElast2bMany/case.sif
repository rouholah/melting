! Simple 2d linear elasticity bending problem.
! Here the monolithic matrix is split into a block matrix
! and then the block matrix strategy is used to solve it.
! 
! different between test case *2 and *2b is that here
! the 'block' is used directly as a linear system method.
!
! This case includes both StressSolver and ElasticSolver to make sure
! that the block technique can be used many times.
