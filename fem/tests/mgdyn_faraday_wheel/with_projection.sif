! This is a special model of the Faraday wheel to test the mortar FE 
! approximation. To this end the wheel is artificially broken into an inner part
! and outer part which are meshed independently. Moreover, the vector potential
! variable is made unique in an iterated manner (the nonlinear iteration is 
! employed for this purpose) by performing the Helmholtz projection after 
! solving the A-V solution candidate. For a similar verification case see the 
! test ../mgdyn_faraday_disc/.
!
! Here a metallic disc rotates and is subject to a uniform magnetic field 
! parallel to the disc axis. When the disc is put to rotate, the mobile charges
! of the conductor start to feel a radial force due to the Lorentz term v x B
! and hence accumulate on the insulated rim surface. As a consequence of charge
! separation a radial electric field E is produced. The process of charge 
! separation continues as long as steady state is reached such that the force on
! the charges which is produced by the Lorentz term v x B balances the force 
! which is produced by E. That is, in the steady state we have 
! 
!               E'(x) = E(x) + v(x) x B(x) = 0, 
!
! with E'(x) being the spatial field that describes the force experienced by 
! a charge (see Elmer Models Manual for Maxwell's equations in terms of E'). 
! Note that the solution is expressed in the spatial coordinates and attention 
! is not fixed on particular material points (this is known as the Euler 
! description in the continuum mechanics).  
!
! The continuity of the A-V solution is enforced weakly over the artificial 
! contact surface of the inner and outer part.
