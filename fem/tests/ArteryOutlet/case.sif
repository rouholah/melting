! 2D arterial flow simulation where inlet is enforced with a physical 
! pump and outlet is obtained from a 1D lumped model utilizing the method
! of characteristics. 
!
! This test case is derived from the older tutorial case
! "Blood ejection from a ventricle into aorta". 
! Here the 1D mesh is created internally while in the old 
! tutorial case it was done by modifying the mesh files directly.
