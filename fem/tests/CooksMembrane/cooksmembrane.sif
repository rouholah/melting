! Here Cook's membrane problem (state of plane strain) is solved by using 
! the neo-Hookean material model subject to large deformation.
! The mixed finite element formulation is employed. With E=200, v=0.35, 
! traction=4.0, the Y-displacement at the corner point (48,60) is found to
! be UY=6.1468 (the value UY=6.1469 has been reported in a thesis work [1]).
