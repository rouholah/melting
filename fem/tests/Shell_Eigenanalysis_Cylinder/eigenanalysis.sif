! This case gives a FE model for a fan blade problem considered in
!
! Olson M, Lindberg G: Vibration analysis of cantilevered curved plates using
! a new cylindrical shell finite element. A report of Air Force Flight Dynamics
! Laboratory, AFFDL-TR-68-150, 1968.
!
! The report lists the first natural frequencies that were measured 
! experimentally. The table below shows the first seven vibration frequencies 
! obtained computationally with the this FE model and the experimental values of
! the report. Note that Elmer outputs true eigenvalues, so to get the natural 
! frequency one needs to compute f = sqrt(lambda)/(2 pi), with lambda being 
! the eigenvalue.
