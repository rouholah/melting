!
! A simple example of one-directional solid-shell coupling
!
! Here the mesh contains both 2-D shell and 3-D solid elements. The 3-D 
! elasticity equations are first solved over the 3-D body and then the shell 
! equations are solved over the shell body by constraining the shell deformation
! to obey the 3-D displacement in the common boundary. The rotation-like 
! variables (directional derivatives) of the shell model are calculated from 
! the solution at the solid nodes found in the positive and negative direction 
! of the shell normal (director).
