!
! A simple example of one-directional shell-solid coupling
!
! Here the mesh contains both 2-D shell and 3-D solid elements. The shell 
! equations are first solved over the shell body and then the 3-D elasticity 
! equations are solved over the 3-D body by using the reaction forces of the 
! shell model as loads. The moment load is handled by converting the work-
! equivalent moments of the shell model to couple loads which are applied at 
! solid nodes found in the positive and negative direction of the shell 
! normal (director). Choosing the right sign and component of the torque needs 
! some care (for example, the torque about the Y-axis tends to produce the
! X-component of rotation-like variable of the shell model).
