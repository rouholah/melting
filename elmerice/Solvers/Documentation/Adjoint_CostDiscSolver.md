### Introduction
This solver computes a cost function which measures the mismatch between the model and some observations as  

$J = \sum_{1}^{Nobs} 0.5 (u-u^{obs})^{2}$

Here the model variable is interpolated at the observations points and the observations do not need to be interpolated on the mesh nodes.

This solver also computes the derivative of the cost function with respect to the nodal variable. The variable that contains the derivative must exist and should be named *velocityb* if the model variable is *Flow Solution* (i.e. solving Stokes) or *ssavelocity* (i.e. solving SSA), or *Varb* for other direct equations (where *Var* is the name of the direct solver variable).

The observations can be given in an ascii or netcdf file. 

The model variable can be a scalar or a vector, and the observations can be only the first *n* components of the variable, e.g. in general only the horizontal components of the surface velocity vector are observed.

Be carefull, this solver will reset the values of the cost and sensitivity to 0; so that it must be used in first place in an assimilation sequence.

In general this solver will be executed on the whole mesh for vertically integrated models or on the upper free surface
for a 3D model and 2D surface observations.

###  Keywords

Bellow are the related keywords in the *.sif* file:  


```
Solver *solver id* 
  
    Equation = String "Cost"  
    procedure = "ElmerIceSolvers" "Adjoint_CostDiscSolver"
    !## No need to declare a variable, this is done internally to insure that Solver structures exist
     
     !# Name of an ascii file that will contain the cost value as
     !## Time, Lambda*J, RMS=sqrt(2J/(Nobs*Lambda))
     Cost Filename = File ""
     
     !# Name of the variable that contain the cost value
     !#  must exist and can be a global variable
     Cost Variable Name = String ""
     
     !# a multiplicatif factor can be used to scale the cost function
     Lambda=Real [default 1.0]
     
     !# The name of the model variable that is observed
     Observed Variable Name = String ""
     
     !# Name of the file that contains the observations
     !## can be netcdf (with .nc extension) or ascii (any other extension)
     !## reading netcdf is only possible for observations in a 2D plane
     !## Coordinates dimension of the Obs. must be consistent with Pb dimension;
     !##  i.e. CoordsystemDim if solver is on the bulk or (CoordsystemDim-1) if solver is on a boundary
     Observation File Name = File "" 
     
     !# If the variable is a vector, how many component do we observe?
     !## it will be the first *n* components
     Observed Variable dimension = Integer ...
   
     !# If true data that have been found in the mesh at the first visit will be saved in an ascii file
     !## will save coordinates, observation, element number
     !## there will be one file per partition
     Save used data = Logical 
     !## if yes name of the output file
      output data file name = File ""
     !## and directory
      output directory = File ""
     
     
     !## Keywords related to Observations in ASCII:
      Parallel Observation Files = Logical  ! if True each partition will read her own file; partition number precede the suffix
     Pre-Processed File = Logical ! if true expect to find the Active element number in last column (i.e. we re-read an ascii file saved by the same solver)
     Element Number is Active Number = Logical ! Set to True if The element number shoudl be interpreted as the the active elemen number
   
     !## Keywords related to Observations in NETCDF:
     X Dim Name = File "" ![default "x"] ! name of the dimension for x
     Y Dim Name = File "" ![default "y"] ! name of the dimension for y
     
     X Var Name = File "" ![default "x"] ! name of the variable for x
     Y Var Name = File "" ![default "y"] ! name of the variable for x
     
     !# Name of the variable that contain the observation
     !## if Observed Variable dimension = 1
     Netcdf Var Name = File "" [default "Name Of The model Observed Variable"]
     !## else
     Netcdf Var 1 Name = File "" [default "vx"]
     Netcdf Var 2 Name = File "" [default "vy"]
     !# The solver will look for the attribute _FillValue to check if the data exist or not
      
  End

```

It is possible to use a passive condition in the body force, if we want to skip the evaluation of the cost function for observations that fall within passive elements.

```
Body Force i
 !# the name of the  solver variable is NameOfEquation_var
 !# keywords relative with passive elements can be used
 Cost_var Passive = ...
End
```

### Limitations and possible improvments

- The search algorithm to locate the observations in the mesh is very efficient if the solver is executed on the whole mesh (e.g. for vertcially integrated models); however it is not efficient if the solver is executed on a boundary. 
In this case, if working with Elmer internal extrusion, it can be advantageus to :  

   - first execute this solver alone on the 2D footprint using 
      - *save used data = Logical TRUE*, 

   - then re-read the saved files using  
     - *Pre-Processed File = Logical TRUE* and  
     - *Element Number is Active Number = Logical TRUE*. 

   - If running parallel, the same number of partitions must be used and set
     - *Parallel Observation Files = Logical True*

- If the observed variable is a vector, data will only be used only if all the observed components are valid. The solver could be updated to use indepently all the observed components.

Bellow is a list of features that are not currently possible in this solver but that could be implemented:

- We could take into account statistics on the observation errors in the definition of the cost function. This could be simple informations on the variance of a full error-covariance matrix.

- We could allow for the possibility that only the norm of a vector is oberved or only the components in a given direction.
